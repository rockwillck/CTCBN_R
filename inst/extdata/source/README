ct-cbn :: Continuous time conjunctive Bayesian networks
-------------------------------------------------------

-- Version 0.1.04a, Nov 2015


Prerequisites:
--------------

CT-CBN requires
- GNU Scientific Library (GSL)
- OpenMP compiler support

Get the GSL from http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/

On Mac OS X, we recommend you install all dependencies via
MacPorts (https://www.macports.org). Once MacPorts is installed,
proceed to install GCC and the GSL with

	sudo port install gcc5 gsl


Installation:
-------------

- Decompress the tarball with
	tar -xjf ct-cbn-0.1.04a.tar.bz2

- Change directory
	cd ct-cbn-0.1.04a

- On Linux, run the configure script
	./configure
  On Mac OS X, also pass it GCC as preferred compiler
	./configure CC=gcc-mp-5
  alternatively, also give the configure script a '--prefix=<DIR>' to install
  to a custom root

- Compile the sources with
	make -j2

- (Optional) install the files with
	make install

- (Optional, if you haven't run the previous step) add the build directory to your PATH.
  When using bash, add the following commands in .bashrc or .bash_profile
	echo export PATH=`pwd`:'$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
	

Description:
------------

'ct-cbn' is an implementation of the continuous time conjunctive Bayesian 
         network as described in Beerenwikel & Sullivant, 
         http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.2646v1.

'h-cbn'  is a more recent implementation of the CBN with an explicit error 
         process.


Usage:
------

Type 'ct-cbn -h' or 'h-cbn -h' for available options.



File formats:
-------------

(a) Pattern files (.pat): 

A binary data matrix preceeded by its dimensions (#rows #columns) 
in the first line. The initial event (column 1) must always occur, 
i.e., all patterns have to start with a 1 followed by a 
space-separated list of 0's and 1's.
Note that the pattern matrix is not checked for validity!

Example with 7 mutations:
10 8
1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1


(b) Poset files (.poset): 

A list of binary relations preceeded by the number of genetic events
(mutations). A relation "i<j" is specified by the line "i j". The end
of the list is indicated by a line containing only a zero.

Example with 7 mutations and 5 relations:
7
6 1
1 5
4 7
7 2
2 3
0


(c) Event name files (.prf):

A list of names of the genetic events. The first row is a dummy, often with
the name 'null' or 'wild type', the next n lines label the genetic events
1, ..., n. Thus the file has n+1 lines for n genetic events. 
This file is _not_ used by the ct-cbn program.
