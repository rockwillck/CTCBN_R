New in version 0.1.04a
---------------------
Autotooled the build system and removed the broken Makefile


New in version 0.1.04
---------------------
+  Cleaned up code

+  -m option shows most likely path.

+  -w option writes output.

+  Only report results of the H-CBN model


New in version 0.1.03
---------------------
Optimized EM_ACCURACY for efficiency


New in version 0.1.01
---------------------
+ Optimized search strategy for simulated annealing: 
  Suggesting relations with probability 
    e^{-change in data explained without errors}

+ Support for calculating MAP estimates as well as GPS (-g option).


New in version 0.1.00
---------------------

+ ct-cbn.h: Functions are now shared in ct-cbn.h

+ h-cbn: Hidden-Markov Conjunctive Bayesian networks:
  Uses EM to estimate posets and parameters from noisy mutation patterns.
  Includes simulated annealing search algorithm to find ML poset. (-L option)

+ Increased performance after profiling (eg, ham_dist()).
  
+ Using openmp for p arallelization:
  Requires gcc > 4.2.


New in version 0.0.03
---------------------

+ Support to calculate genetic progression score (GPS).

+ Fixed bug while reducing to cover relations:
  New function reduce_to_cover_relations() uses BFS to search whole lattice, 
  instead of comparing only pairs.

+ Fixed bug in function draw_samples():
  gsl_ran_exp() has mu = 1/lambda as its argument instead of lambda.
